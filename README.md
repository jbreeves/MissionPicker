**About**
Have you ever been playing a RPG video game and had so many open quests that you couldn't decide which to do next? Let this script decide for you! Once you enter the names of your missions, they will be added to an array. Once this array is populated, a random number generator will pick a number from the amount of missions available and the corresponding mission will be displayed.

Happy adventuring!
